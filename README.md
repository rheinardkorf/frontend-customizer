# fe-customizer
A starting point for new WordPress plugins.

This plugin base requires at least PHP 5.3+ to use interfaces, abstract classes and anonymous functions. PHP 5.4+ is required to make use of *traits*.

Although there is a `tests` folder with some initial tests, this base is not setup out of the box for unit testing.

You might want to override the following in the plugin:

- `FE Customizer` to be the name of your plugin.  
- `FECustomizer` with the package and namespace of your plugin.
- `*fe-customizer*` slugs, textdomains and handles for the plugin.
- `*fe_customizer*` function names.
- `XWP` to your name.
- `https://xwp.co` to be your url.
- `2017` to the current year.
- `0.1-alpha` to the plugin version.
